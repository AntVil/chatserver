#presentation infp: 
-10-15min
-20% of grade
-chat (frontend + backend)

#design choices:
-constant requests to stay logged in (prevent people being in list of online users)
    -> constant request is hard to do and unneccecary
    -> people are logged of after inactivity and instatnly reconnected once the page reloads
    -> user doesn't notice, being logged of
    -> feature online "truly" active people are visable in user list

#problems:
-storing messages -> to text-document with seperation characters
-special html characters in messages -> replacing with HTML encodings
-keeping track of active users -> design choice
-too many messages make chat less readable -> autoScroll
